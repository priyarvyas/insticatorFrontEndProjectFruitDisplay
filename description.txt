Description:
  Create a single page application utilizing React/Redux or vanilla JS.

Requirements:
  1. Create a UI based on the mockup given. Accuracy counts.

  2. Display each item found in the "store_items.json" file. Each item should show the name, image, price and quantity remaining.

  3. Users should have the ability to remove an item from the display.

  4. Users should be able to sort items by highest/lowest price.

* Helpful Hints:
	- Directory structure and component architecture count (build with extensibility in mind)
	- UI and UX count!
	- Bonus points for proper display at different screen sizes

Good luck!:
  Once complete, please send a github link or a zip of your project files.
